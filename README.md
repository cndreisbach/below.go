Below
=====

"Below" is a [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) written in
[Google's Go programming language](http://golang.org/). That is, it _will be_ a
roguelike, when there's more of it. Right now, it's not much.

I'm following [Steve Losh's "Caves of Clojure" series](http://stevelosh.com/blog/)
in order to start this.

Running it
----------
Do you have Go installed? If not, do that.

Then, go to the project's root directory and type:

    go get
    go build

You should now have an executable called `below`. Run that. If you got errors about installing dependencies, I hope you know something about Go!

When playing the game, type `s` to smooth the world, `Return` to win, and anything else to lose.

My favorite roguelike
----------------------

My favorite roguelike is [Brogue](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/).
Hopefully, this game will be inspired by it someday.
